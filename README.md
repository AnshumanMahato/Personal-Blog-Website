# Headless Hashnode CMS

This website uses Headless Hashnode CMS to fetch and display blog posts. You can use it for free. It consumes [Hashnode's Public APIs](https://apidocs.hashnode.com/), and gives you a fully customizable blog that can be deployed anywhere, including a subpath of a custom domain. Combined with [Hashnode's headless](https://hashnode.com/headless) mode, it unlocks entirely new possibilities. You can now use [Hashnode's world class editor](https://hashnode.com/neptune) and dashboard to author content and collaborate.

## How to deploy for yourself

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Create a Hashnode account and create a blog. (ignore if you already have one) 
3. Create a new Github Personal Access Token with `repo` scope. [Here's how](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). This will be used to fetch your Github pinned projects.
4. For testing locally. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:
    
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_GQL_ENDPOINT=https://gql.hashnode.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_HOST="your-blog-name.hashnode.dev"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="/blogs"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MODE=development
    HOST_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.github.com/graphql
    GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-github-personal-access-token"
    ```
5. Make required adjustments. Most of the personal information can be updated from [app/lib/profile.json](/app/lib/profile.json). You can test locally by running `npm run dev`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash {"id":"01J21MEVQTB8WMQ07AWE7J0DJY"}
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
