# Headless Hashnode CMS

This website uses Headless Hashnode CMS to fetch and display blog posts. You can use it for free. It consumes [Hashnode's Public APIs](https://apidocs.hashnode.com/), and gives you a fully customizable blog that can be deployed anywhere, including a subpath of a custom domain. Combined with [Hashnode's headless](https://hashnode.com/headless) mode, it unlocks entirely new possibilities. You can now use [Hashnode's world class editor](https://hashnode.com/neptune) and dashboard to author content and collaborate.

## Local Development

1. Fork and clone this repository

2. Create a Hashnode account and create a blog. (ignore if you already have one)

3. Create a new Github Personal Access Token with `repo` scope. [Here's how](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). This will be used to fetch your Github pinned projects.

4. For testing locally. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_GQL_ENDPOINT=https://gql.hashnode.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_HOST="your-blog-name.hashnode.dev"
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_BASE_PATH="/blogs"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODE=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=test
HOST_URL="http://localhost:3000"
GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.github.com/graphql
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-github-personal-access-token"
HASHNODE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=hn_whs_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

```

5. Make required adjustments. Most of the personal information can be updated from [app/lib/profile.json](/app/lib/profile.json).

6. To test locally, first install dependencies with `npm install` and then run `npm run dev`.

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Follow the steps mentioned in the [Local Development](#local-development) section.

2. Create a new Vercel account and connect your Github account. Skip if you already have one.

3. Import this repository to Vercel.

4. Add the environment variables mentioned in the [Local Development](#local-development) section to Vercel's environment variables. Make the following adjustments:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODE=production
HOST_URL="https://your-website-url"

```

5. Deploy the project.

6. Your website should be live now.

7. If you want to use a custom domain, you can add it from the Vercel dashboard. Read more about it [here](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain).

8. Go to your hashnode blog settings.

9. In the domain section, enable headless mode and add blog base url as `your-website-url/blogs`.

Your blog should be live now.
